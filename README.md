# Fraudulent_Claim_Detection_Niharika_Sravan_Pankaj

Project Overview

The Fraudulent Claim Detection project is a data-driven initiative designed to identify potentially fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent claims can cost insurance companies millions of dollars annually, making early and accurate detection critical. This project demonstrates the complete workflow from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model building and evaluation, providing actionable insights for insurance and financial organizations.

Objectives

Detect fraudulent insurance claims using historical claim data.

Explore patterns and trends that distinguish legitimate claims from fraudulent ones.

Build and evaluate predictive models to classify claims effectively.

Provide visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders.

Demonstrate the practical application of machine learning in the insurance sector.

Dataset

The dataset includes various features related to insurance claims, such as:

Claim amount

Policyholder information

Claim submission details

Historical claim behavior

Additional indicators of suspicious activity

The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed to be suitable for machine learning models.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Handling missing values and outliers

Encoding categorical variables

Normalizing and scaling numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identifying patterns and correlations between features

Visualizing claim distributions and potential anomalies

Understanding key indicators of fraudulent activity

Model Building

Implemented machine learning classification models such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Optimized models using hyperparameter tuning

Model Evaluation

Confusion matrix analysis to identify false positives and negatives

Visualization & Reporting

Feature importance plots

Fraud vs. genuine claim distributions

Interactive dashboards (optional) to communicate results

Results

Successfully identified patterns and features indicative of fraudulent claims.

Achieved strong performance metrics with the selected classification models.

Provided actionable insights that could help reduce financial losses in real-world insurance operations.
